		<h1>Title of the Letter</h1>
		<p>We are clinicians and researchers who work with and study transgender and gender diverse youth. Many of us are involved in debates about how best to care for transgender and gender diverse youth – debates about to whom, when, and how gender affirming medical care might best be provided.  Discussion of some of these debates has moved into the public sphere. We hold varying perspectives of these issues and sometimes disagree.</p>
		
<p>However, often lost in the public version of these debates is our strong agreement about two central points that we wish to highlight here. First, there is consensus in the field, and amongst these signatories, that gender affirming medical care is important and beneficial for many transgender youth. Second, we do not support laws restricting access to gender affirmative care. As with all medical care, we believe an adolescent’s health care, including their access to gender affirming medical care, should be determined by the youth in consultation with their families and health care teams. </p>
		
<p>Recently, our internal debate and media reports of our debate concerning how best to care for transgender youth have been cited to support laws banning gender affirmative medical care for minors, punishing doctors who provide this care, or otherwise limiting this care. We write this letter to make our position on this crystal clear: The signatories below all believe, based on the current evidence, that gender affirmative medical care is an important part of many transgender adolescents’ overall medical care, and that states and health systems should not restrict access to that care.</p>

<p>We will continue to debate aspects of gender affirming care, just as clinicians and researchers in all areas of medicine debate aspects of care. We will continue to update our views as new data and more evidence are accrued. However, we request that politicians and others stop using our debates to justify bans of gender affirmative care. We wish to state for the public record, we do not support these efforts.
